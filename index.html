            <h1>A Little Bit About Me</h1><br>
            <p>Born and raised in Houston, Texas. I am used to hot weather, Tex-Mex, and driving to get where I want (walking, biking, and paying for parking
                are foreign concepts to me). Lately I have been traveling and have been shocked to see that breakfast burritos are not everyone's number one 
                choice of food, but on the plus side pretty much everywhere else has nicer weather than Houston. As a life long procrastinator with 
                a tendency to take paths of least resistance I am trying to be more productive and goal oriented in all aspects of life and take self improvement
                more seriously.<br>

            <p>
                I come from a finance background working on collateralized loan obligations, handling client queries and requests, setting up quarterly payments 
                and reports, and yadda yadda other duties that I did not find particularly interesting or inspiring, though the experience by itself was informative 
                because of the people I worked with. In time I began to rethink some things in my life and one of them was the question of fulfillment and what that means 
                to me. After some soul searching I decided that to get anywhere I first had to re-evaluate my career choice, a decision an earlier version of me made
                without much thought for the future. I had been toying with the idea of attending a coding bootcamp but never took it seriously, categorizing it under 
                my list of "Interesting Things I Should Try... but, eh" next to sky diving and taking a solo Europe trip. However, I began to consider this option very
                seriously the more uninspiring my current trajectory seemed and began to research everything about coding, bootcamps, success stories, realistic expectations,
                etc. The more I researched, the more determined I became to make a career change. I decided to not waste anymore time on my current life trajectory and 
                left my job, bade farewell to my colleagues, packed up and settled into a tiny studio in Seattle. It's currently June, my last class will be in October and
                I can't wait to see how this journey will turn out.<br>
                As a prospective future developer, I want to be able to contribute to projects in a meaningful way - to be a part of the process of designing and building
                something. I also want to be able to do something with my skills if I have an idea I want to execute on, or have the flexibility to travel and work 
                in any location that has access to wifi. These are possibilities that I believe learning to code provides and in my opinion makes coding a strong choice 
                that aligns with my future goals.<br>
